<h3 align="center">
  In physics, spacetime is any mathematical model which fuses the three dimensions of space and the one dimension of time into a single four-dimensional manifold. Spacetime diagrams can be used to visualize relativistic effects, such as why different observers perceive differently where and when events occur.

<h3 align="center">
 Starfield was built to visualize the very core of space-time. how we perceive and see reality in a different point of view. The point of creating Starfield is to make simulations more accesible to everyone.
